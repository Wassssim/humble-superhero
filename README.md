# Humble Superhero API

## How to Collaborate

- If working in a team, we can extend this with a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Implement authentication for superhero submissions.
- Add pagination and filtering.

## If I Had More Time

- Add a simple React frontend to interact with the API.
- Implement a real database instead of an in-memory array.
- Add unit tests for the controller and integration tests.
